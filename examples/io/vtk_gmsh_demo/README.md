## LehrFEM++ VTK Gmsh Demo

The file `io_demo.cc` illustrates how to read a (Gmsh) mesh stored in a `.msh` 
file, how to read different physical entities from the mesh and how to store 
cell- and node-based functions as a `.vtk` file. The `.vtk` file can be 
viewed in ParaView by opening the ParaView Client, loading the file and 
clicking `Apply` in the `Properties` section.
