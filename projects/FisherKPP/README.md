This folder contains the code developed in the context of the [bachelor thesis](http://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/%7Ehiptmair/StudentProjects/Loher.Amelie/BScThesis_LoherAmelie_FisherKPP.pdf) "Solving the Fisher/KPP equation on the globe" by Am√©lie Loher under the advisorship of Prof. Dr. Ralf Hiptmair. The content encloses the main simulation, the simulation for the model problems on simplified domains, as well as the implementation for the convergence analysis.
