This folder contains the implementation of the Fisher/KPP equation on the globe. This project was developed in the frame of a Bachelor thesis "Solving the FisherKPP Evolution on the Globe" by Am√©lie Loher under the advisorship of Prof. Dr. Ralf Hiptmair. The main simulation is produced with the file "strangsplitting_main.cc". The convergence studies were performed with the files "convergence_*", whereas the model problem was considered through the files "modelproblem_*".
